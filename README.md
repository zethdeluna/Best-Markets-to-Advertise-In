# Best-Markets-to-Advertise-In
In this project, we'll use the fundamentals of statistics (distribution summaries using the mean, median, mode, measures of variability, z-scores, etc.) to make business analyses. We'll analyze data from freeCodeCamp's 2017 survey to find out which two countries should we spend our advertising budget on.

## The Data
The data analyzed in this project was taken from freeCodeCamp's 2017 survey, available [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).
